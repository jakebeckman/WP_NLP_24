									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>The following is my personal statement for graduate school applications</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My name is Jake Beckman, a fourth-year cadet at the United States Military Academy majoring in operations research. For as long as I can remember, I have dreamed of attending West Point and dedicating myself to a life of service in the United States Army. During my time at the academy, the concept of ‘service’ has been the cornerstone of all I do, shaping who I am today, helping those around me and giving back to the communities that have supported my journey. My experiences at West Point, whether in military leadership roles, academic research, or community outreach, have not only reinforced my commitment to service but have also inspired my pursuit of higher education. I firmly believe that advanced education is the most effective way to prepare for continued military service and to contribute meaningfully to the communities that got me here.</p>
								<p>As a member of the Leadership, Ethics, and Diversity in STEM (LEADS) program, I have had the privilege of traveling to underrepresented communities across the country to promote opportunities at West Point, the value of military service, and the importance of higher education. Being a minority in the Army, it has been deeply rewarding to offer guidance and support to these communities. The interactions I have had with students through this program have fueled my drive to become the best leader I can be when I commission into the Army. This motivation has also led me to pursue graduate school. I see advanced education not only as a means to enhance my own capabilities but also as a way to serve as an ambassador for the profession of arms, using the skills I gain to benefit others.</p>
								<p>My commitment to pursuing a graduate degree in data science stems from my experiences at West Point, particularly through my involvement in research groups like the Research and Analysis Center (TRAC) and the Research Facilitation Laboratory (RFL). At TRAC, I contributed to developing and optimizing a simulation for noncombatant evacuation operations, which underscored the importance of research in improving military efficiency. This experience introduced me to the field of simulation, highlighting its significant impact on military operations. During my time at RFL, I analyzed large datasets related to mental health diagnoses and retention rates among soldiers. This project illuminated the critical need for skilled analysts within the Army to address complex challenges using data-driven approaches. I am passionate about filling this need and believe that a graduate education will provide me with the advanced skills necessary to contribute effectively to the Army's mission.</p>
								<p>Beyond the military, my research at West Point has opened my eyes to the broader applications of data science and operations research in healthcare. I previously worked on research aimed at creating a predictive model for type 2 diabetes using data from mixed meal tolerance testing. This project introduced me to survival statistics models, such as Cox-proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. This early exposure to medical research ignited my passion for using data science to address health-related issues. For my capstone project, I am exploring the effect of genetic makeup on physical activity, delving into the intersection of genetics, health, and data science. This research has deepened my interest in personalized healthcare and has inspired me to continue exploring this niche during graduate school. To streamline the research process, I am also developing a new standard for conducting literature reviews using artificial intelligence and machine learning models. This approach allows me to efficiently parse through vast databases, further demonstrating the broad applicability of my operations research skillset. </p>
								<p>Pursuing these lines of research at the graduate level will enable me to delve deeper into critical healthcare issues, contributing to advancements in both scientific understanding and public health outcomes. Amidst growing health crises in our country, I believe a data-driven approach is crucial to accurately inform healthcare decisions, benefiting individuals and communities alike. I am excited by the potential to apply my education to address these pressing challenges, whether within the Army or in the civilian sector.</p>
								<p>Should I pursue graduate school, I will have a six-year active-duty service obligation upon completion of the program. I am confident that the advanced education I receive will open numerous opportunities within the Army, particularly in roles such as an operations research and systems analyst (ORSA). If I choose to transition out of the Army in the future, I intend to leverage my education to continue serving others, particularly in the healthcare field. With a degree in data science, I aim to apply data-driven solutions to improve healthcare and enhance the lives of individuals and their communities. Ultimately, my goal is to use my skills to contribute meaningfully to society, embodying the principles of service that have guided me throughout my journey.</p>
